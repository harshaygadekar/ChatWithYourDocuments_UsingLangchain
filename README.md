## Chat with your documents using LangChainüîó

<b>This Python script demonstrates how to use the LangChain library to build a conversational AI assistant that can interact with documents of various formats (PDF, Markdown, and text files) stored in a directory. 

The script performs the following steps:

- Loads and combines the documents from the specified directory using different document loaders.
- Splits the text from the documents into smaller chunks using a text splitter.
- Generates embeddings (vector representations) for the text chunks using OpenAI's embedding model.
- Stores the embeddings and associated text chunks in a vector database (Chroma or Pinecone) for efficient similarity search.
- Sets up a conversational retrieval chain that uses the stored embeddings to retrieve relevant text chunks based on user queries.

Provides two user interfaces:

- A simple widget-based interface using IPython and ipywidgets, where users can enter questions, and the assistant responds with relevant information from the documents.
- A Gradio-based chat interface with a more polished UI, where users can engage in a conversational interaction with the assistant.</b>
